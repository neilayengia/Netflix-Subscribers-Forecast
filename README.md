 Netflix Subscriptions Forecast
This project focuses on forecasting the growth of Netflix subscriptions over time using historical data. By calculating and visualizing the yearly growth rate, it provides insights into the trends of Netflix's subscriber base and future growth prospects.

 Project Overview
Netflix has seen significant growth over the years, and this project aims to forecast future subscription trends by analyzing historical subscriber data. The project calculates the percentage change in subscribers year-over-year and visualizes the results using interactive bar graphs.

 Key Objectives:
Calculate Yearly Growth Rate: Determine how Netflix subscriptions have grown or shrunk over the years.
Visualize Subscription Growth: Provide clear visual insights into yearly changes in Netflix's subscriber base.
Forecast Future Trends: Utilize historical growth data to make informed predictions about future subscription trends.
 Techniques & Tools
1. Forecasting & Growth Rate Calculation
Yearly Growth Rate Calculation: Group data by year and apply percentage change (pct_change()) to calculate the annual growth rate of subscribers.
Conditional Formatting: Based on the growth rate, different colors are used in the bar graph (green for positive growth, red for negative growth).
2. Data Visualization
Plotly: Interactive bar charts are used to visualize the yearly growth rates of Netflix subscribers. The graph highlights changes in subscription growth over time, making it easy to spot trends.
 Data Insights
Yearly Subscriber Growth: The project reveals trends in the yearly subscription growth rate, helping to understand when Netflix experienced rapid expansion and when growth slowed.
Visual Trends: By color-coding the growth rate (green for positive and red for negative), it's easy to quickly assess periods of success or decline.
 Libraries & Frameworks
Pandas: For data manipulation and preparation, including grouping by year and calculating percentage growth.
Plotly: For creating interactive bar charts to display the growth rates with conditional coloring based on positive or negative growth.
 Results
This project reveals the yearly growth trends of Netflix subscribers, showing periods of strong growth as well as declines.
Forecasting future subscription growth based on historical data allows stakeholders to anticipate future trends.
